"""Walk a project's pydantic model tree into the documentation IR.

The project path documents the *abstract standard*: the template of what is
allowed/required. Slice 1 covers global attributes only — name, description,
example and required/optional status — read straight off the model fields. The
walk keys on the canonical CDM field name ``attributes`` (the ``Vocal*Mixin`` is
a sanity check only — a mismatch is recorded as a diagnostic, never raised).

The walk threads a ``diagnostics`` list through the recursion so documentation
gaps — undescribed validators and field-name/mixin mismatches — are collected
inline (no separate lint pass) and surfaced on the returned ``ProjectDoc``.
